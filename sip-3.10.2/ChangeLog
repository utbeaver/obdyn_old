than one wrapped class.


2000/12/24 18:30:09  phil
Fixed a bug that meant some signal proxies were not being generated properly
(only affected QMovie).
When a C++ instance takes ownership, it also takes a reference to the Python
object as well.
Updated the documentation for v2.3.


2000/12/19 14:48:31  phil
Added the ability to add pre- and post-call hooks. Added the sipCallHook()
function to implement them.


2000/12/15 11:18:00  phil
Added a couple of missing Python exceptions.


2000/12/13 10:41:12  phil
Updated the configuration to look for Qt v2.2.3.


2000/12/12 17:48:53  phil
Changed sipParseArgs() to take an extra parameter to enable better error
messages to be reported.
Changed the sipNo*() functions to report the better messages.
Changed the code generator to use the changed sipParseArgs().


2000/11/05 20:56:28  phil
Added the $P macro.
Backed out the change making the wrapper class dtors virtual (causes problems
under Windows).
Released v2.2.


2000/11/04 11:06:11  phil
Made the wrapper class dtor virtual to avoid compiler warning messages.
Fixed proxy class generation for modules that don't define any new signals.


2000/11/02 15:03:13  phil
Minor compile fixes (why is it always RedHat?).
Added the %Copying directive.
Clarified the license regarding generated code.


2000/10/18 16:20:53  phil
Final tidying up for the release of v2.1.


2000/10/15 20:41:24  phil
Finally fixed the problem with signal signatures defined with SIP_CON_SLOT.
Updated the documentation for v2.1pre1.


2000/10/13 19:00:17  phil
Fixed really nasty segv with complex Python expressions where the wrapped
object was (legitimately) outliving the class instance.


2000/10/11 17:23:05  phil
Slot types that are only specified by SIP_CON_SLOT (and not as a signal) are
now handled properly.


2000/10/11 13:34:03  phil
Added the ability to provide handwritten code for dtors.
Added the sipGetThisWrapper() function to the SIP library.


2000/10/02 21:46:56  phil
Fixed the bad code generated for Python special methods (ie. operators).


2000/10/01 12:32:19  phil
Slots that take fewer arguments than the number supplied by a signal will not
cause an exception - just like Qt.


2000/10/01 00:44:57  phil
Fixed the signal handling bug introduced a couple of days ago while trying to
fix another signal handling bug.


2000/09/29 22:28:26  phil
When a wrapped class instance is deleted it is now guaranteed that the
underlying object will be deleted after all of the instances variables.  This
avoids some potentially very subtle bugs.


2000/09/23 18:07:05  phil
Connecting Python signals to Qt slots (expressed using SLOT()) now works.
Increased the library version number to 3.0.1.


2000/09/20 10:57:10  phil
Tidy up after moving the CVS tree to theKompany.com CVS repository.
